<img src="assets/chadgpt-interface.png" width="600" alt="ChadGPT Interface">

ChadGPT is an AI-powered assistant leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to support caregivers of individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) by analyzing an individual's documentation (behavioral reports, medical reports, anecdotal documents) and providing personalized insights.
